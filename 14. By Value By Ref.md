## By Value and By Reference

- by value:
  - we have a Primitive Type, and a variable "a" that has the address and points to the value.
  - b = a, 
  - b is pointing to a seperated location, a copy of value. b has a new address.
  - by value, means by copying the value into two seperate spots in memory.
  - when you mutate one, the other is not affected, cause they are SEPERSTED.
  
- by reference:
  - when it comes to Object. (including Functions)
  - we have a variable that points to the object.
  - b = a.
  - b is pointing the same address of the original object.
  - no matter what variable you change, the other got CHANGED.
  
- Primitives by Value, while Objects by Refence.


## "=" equal operator sets up new memory space

```
c = {
 greet: "howdy"
};
```
- setting c equals to a New Value
- because the equal operator saw that object doesn't exist in the memory, so it created a space for the object, and then pointed c to this address.
