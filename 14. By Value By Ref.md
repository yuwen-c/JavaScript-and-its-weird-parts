## By Value and By Reference

- by value:
  - we have a Primitive Type, and a variable "a" that has the address and points to the value.
  - b = a, 
  - b is pointing to a seperated location, a copy of value. b has a new address.
  - by value, means by copying the value into two seperate spots in memory.
  - when you mutate one, the other is not affected, cause they are SEPERSTED.
  
- by reference:
  - when it comes to Object. (including Functions)
  - we have a variable that points to the object.
  - b = a.
  - b is pointing the same address of the original object.
  - no matter what variable you change, the other got CHANGED.
  
- Primitives by Value, while Objects by Refence.


## "=" equal operator sets up new memory space

```
c = {
 greet: "howdy"
};
```
- setting c equals to a New Value
- because the equal operator saw that object doesn't exist in the memory, so it created a space for the object, and then pointed c to this address.

  
## code

```
// by value
// primitive type

var a=3;
var b=2;
b=a;

console.log(a,b); //3,3

a=5;
console.log(a,b); //5,3

// a and b are pointing to different address.


// by reference
// objects, functions.


var c={"greet":"hello"};
var d;
d=c;

console.log(c);
console.log(d);

c.greet="hola";

console.log(c); //hola
console.log(d); //hola

//while c and d are pointing to the same address, change one then the other is changed too.

// by reference (even as parameter)

function changeGreeting(obj){
    obj.greet="hi";
}

changeGreeting(c);

console.log(c); //hi
console.log(d); //hi

// equals operator, special case

c={"greeting":"Woooo"};

console.log(c); // Woooo
console.log(d); // hi

// Woooo is a new object so the memory sets a new space for it, then points c to that address.
```
