## big words

- syntax parser: a program that read your code and determines what this code is and also if the code is valid.
they can also do other things which the programmers of these parsers want.


- lexical environment: where the code is written, and what surrounds it.

- execution context: a wrapper of the code that is actually running, it also contains what you've written in your code.

- name/ value pair: a name that represents a unique value

- object: collection of the name/ value pairs.
a name with a value, which might contains a list of names and values, which in turn might have other name/ value pairs

- global: things that you can access everywhere in your code

- global execution context: when its running, it creates a global object abd 'this'


## Synchronous and singal threading

- singal threaded: Javascript doing one thing at a time

- synchronous:Javascript executing code one line at a time, in order.

## function invocation

- invocation: run a function

## Execution Stack

phase 1:
1. 'Global' execution context, variable 'this', global object => window ( if you use a browser)
2. attach all the functions to it and set up the space

phase 2:
3. it reads line by line. when it runs a funtion, a new execution context show up in 'execution stack'
* the execution context on top of the stack, is the one currently running.

** every function invocation creates a new execution context.
** each execution context has a create phase, then execution phase.
** that means, in every execution context, it creats it's own space for variables and functions.

4. when the invocations runs to the end, it's execution context popped up and the next context keeps running.
