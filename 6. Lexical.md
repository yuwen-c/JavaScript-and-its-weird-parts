## the chain scope

```
function b (){
  console.log(myVar)
}

fuctifunction a(){
  var myVar=2
  b()
}

var myVar = 1;
a();
```

=> 1

when a execution context runs b(),
there is no myVar in that environment,
so it looks down to the outter environment, which is global environment in this case, for this variable.

=> this process calls: the chain scope

the execution stackes are: (from above to button)
b()
a()
global

the ouuter space doesn't mean the next stack,
but the LEXICALLY where the function is situated.
