## primitive types

- undefined
- number: float
- null: do not set a variable "undefined", use null.
- boolean
- string
- symbol: in the next version of JS.

## dynamic type


## operators
- operators are FUNCTIONS that return the results of your parameters.
- operator precedence: the priority of execute a function.
  - reference: javascript operator precedence
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence
- associativity: left to right, right to left.

- equal=: right to left associativity
  it returns the value of the right parameter
  
## coercion

- coersion: javascript 'corrects' the types of parameters "in its way",
so that a string and a number can be added as a combination string.

- try this code:
```
console.log(1<2<3)
```
TRUE.
<br>
">,<" are left to right associativity.
first we compare 1<2, equals to true, so that becomes true<3,
then JAVASCRIPT coerses true to 1.
then that's it.

```
console.log(3<2<1)
```
TRUE.
<br>
again, 3<2 equals to false, so we compare false<1,
while false is coersed to 0, we get that the answer is true.

## compairson

- ==: coercion automatically
- ===: do not coercion, please.

- !=: coercion
- !==: not coercion

- reference: javascript comparison ans sameness.

## use coercion to check if a parameter has been set

use coersion as an advantage:

```
var a; 

if (a)
{ console.log("something is there!"); }

```

if a is undefined, null, ""; it coersed false.
check if a exists.

*  var a = 0;
0 is coersed to false, so this test won't work, because 0 is something, it's meaningful.


## use coercion to set default value of a function

```
function greeting （name）{

console.log（"hello!"+ name)

}
```
if we run:
greeting();

```
hello! undefined
```
it means that the undefined valeue has been coerced to string!
