## asynchronous o synchronous?

Event Queue:

- When javascript is running, browser put events(like click event) into a "list", a "Event Queue".

- Event queue is kind of ToDoList.

- When the stack is empty, javascript engine then PERIODICALLY look at that list, 
and execute functions which responde to the events on the list. (the events are triggered).
Again, an execution context is createdâ€¦


- Actually, SIMULTANEOUSLY an action is being added on the list, which is executed by other part, 
but the Javascript engine executes code line by line, in order, SYNCHRONOUSLY.
