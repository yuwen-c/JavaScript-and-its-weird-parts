## Hoisting

- put this code in the previous file:

```
var a = 'Hello World!';

function b() {
    console.log('called b!')
}

b();
console.log(a);
```
  - it runs perfect.

- Then change it's order:

```
b();
console.log(a);

var a = 'Hello World!';

function b() {
    console.log('called b!')
}

```
  - Weird thing happens,
  function b() runs, and variable a is undefined.
  there is no error.
  
- if we try this:
```
b();
console.log(a);

// var a = 'Hello World!';

function b() {
    console.log('called b!')
}

```
  - we'll see a truly error message.
  
## Execution context 

- creation phase
  - global object (window) in the memory
  - this in the memory
  - outer environment
  
  - before executoin, javascript engine has already set aside the memory for variables and functions.
  - functions are ste up entirely in the memory, but the variables are not,
  variable = undefined (as an placeholder) 
  
- execution phase
  - actually execute line by line
  - the value of variables are set in this phase.
